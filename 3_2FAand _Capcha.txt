Disable 2FA using CSRF file. But I have seen that there is token is generated in the CSRF poc. But when I tried this html file that token is never get expired. This token is used again and again to disable 2FA on another Account.

Note : Always try to Disable 2FA using CSRF Attack.

Steps to Reproduce the Vulnerability
Go to https://pandao.ru/profile/settings and sign up for two accounts. In which first is attackers account and second is Victim’s
Log in to Attackers account and capture the Disable 2FA request in Burp suite and generate CSRF poc.
Save the CSRF poc file with extension .HTML.
Now log in into Victim’s account in Private Browser and fire that CSRF file. Now you can see that It disable 2FA which leads to 2FA Bypass.


I enabled the 2FA.
After enabling 2FA, i got some backup codes in case i don’t have access to my device for the TOTP.
I have noted all the backup codes. The backup codes were of 8 digits.
I logged out of the application to test the 2fa. :P
So after entering the email address and password.
I was asked to enter the TOTP. But there was option to login to the application using the backup codes.
I clicked on it. And intentionally, put a random 8 digit number instead of that 8 digit backup code and to my surprise,
it was accepted and i was successfully logged in to the application!
In short, there was no validation for the backup code. They were not validated and hence any random 8 digit would work.


check with enable 2fa and disable account and reenable check it is asking 2fa or not
